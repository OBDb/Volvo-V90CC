    description: "The Volvo V90CC (Cross Country) is the rugged, adventure-oriented variant of the V90 luxury wagon, continuing Volvo's Cross Country tradition that began with the V70 XC in 1997. Launched in 2017 as part of Volvo's revitalized 90-series lineup, it's built on the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform shared with the standard V90, S90, and XC90. The Cross Country features increased ground clearance (approximately 65mm higher than the standard V90), standard all-wheel drive, and protective body cladding around the wheel arches, side sills, and bumpers. The exterior design shares the elegant, clean lines of the V90 but with a more robust, adventure-ready appearance. The interior is nearly identical to the standard V90, showcasing Scandinavian luxury with premium materials including wood, leather, and metal accents, centered around a 9-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen that controls most vehicle functions. Powertrain options initially included various Drive-E four-cylinder engines, primarily the T5 turbocharged and T6 turbo- and supercharged variants, with later updates adding mild-hybrid technology. A 2020 facelift brought subtle design updates, new technology features, and standardized mild-hybrid powertrains. Advanced safety and driver assistance systems are comprehensive, including Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capability, City Safety collision avoidance, and numerous other features that continue Volvo's safety leadership. The V90CC successfully combines luxury, versatility, and all-road capability, appealing to outdoor enthusiasts who prefer wagons to traditional SUVs."
